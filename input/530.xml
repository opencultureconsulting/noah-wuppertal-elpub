          <dc:description xml:lang="en">In the present thesis, the tools of modern density functional theory are applied to study reactivities and NMR chemical shifts of organotitanium und -iron complexes.&lt;br&gt;&#13;
In the first part it is shown for a model system that cationic titanium complexes of the type L2TiR+ (R=growing alkyl chain) can be viable intermediates in the homogeneous olefin polymerisation catalysed by titanium beta-diketonato complexes.&#13;
Olefin insertion in beta- and alpha-agostic intermediates is a facile process on the potential energy surface, but a substantial barrier for the chain propagation is computed on the free energy surface, 15.8 kcal/mol at 298 K.&#13;
Chain termination via beta-H transfer requires significantly higher activation, consistent with the observation of polymerisation, rather than oligomerisation.&#13;
Electron-withdrawing substituents at the diketonato ligand are predicted to lower the barrier for chain propagation, e.g. by 4.5 kcal/mol for L=F3CC(O)CHC(O)CF3 (hfac).&#13;
Thus, hfac complexes should produce highly active catalysts.&#13;
Theoretical methods for the calculation of 49Ti chemical shifts are assessed for a set of inorganic and organometallic titanium compounds, and the exchange-correlation functional best suited for this purpose is identified.&lt;br&gt;&#13;
In the second part, catalytic conversion of MeOH and SiH4 to MeSiOH3 and H2 at a [Fe(Cp)(CO)(PR3)]+ center is studied.&#13;
Intermediates and transition states for R'=H and Ph are characterized along the catalytic cycle, the rate-determining step of which is indicated to be H2 dissociation from [Fe(Cp)(CO)(PR3)(H2)]+, in accord with a mechanistic study for higher substituted substrates from the literature.&#13;
For the model catalyst (R=H), introduction of SiMe3, NMe2, COMe, NO2, CN or Cl subtituents at the Cp ring decreases the rate-determining barrier (up to 6 kcal/mol for NMe2).&#13;
In the transient, free [Fe(C5H4X)(CO)(PR3)]+ complex, there can be competition between the substituent X and the phenyl group of the PPh_3 ligand for a hemilabile intramolecular coordination to iron.&#13;
Modification of the phosphine is thus expected to open further possibilities for tuning the catalyst properties and activities.&lt;br&gt;&#13;
In the third part, thermal and solvent effects on 57Fe chemical shift of [Fe(CN)5(NO)]2- and [Fe(CN)6]4- are simulated with a molecular-dynamics (MD)-based approach.&#13;
Born-Oppenheimer MD simulations were performed employing a QM/MM scheme, in which the solvent, water, is described by a classical force field with electrostatic embedding into the quantum-mechanical part.&#13;
Magnetic shieldings are computed for snapshots along the trajectories.&#13;
Very large thermal and solvent effects on 57Fe chemical shift are obtained, and the final simulated values are in good accord with experiment.&#13;
The simulations offer detailed insights into the hydration spheres around the complexes, as assessed by the average number of hydrogen-bonded water molecules and by suitable pair correlation functions.</dc:description>
