          <dc:description xml:lang="en">Foods are complex multi-component systems which are composed of volatile and non-volatile&#13;
substances. The flavour profile of a food is an important criterion for the selection of our&#13;
foodstuffs.&#13;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The main objective of this study was the clarification of the complex relationships of the&#13;
flavour release as a function of the composition of the food matrix at molecular level.&#13;
Therefore the influence of matrix effects onto the partition coefficients, odour activity values&#13;
and sensory properties of selected flavour compounds, in model and in real food systems were&#13;
investigated. Different matrices were selected to measure their influence onto the partition&#13;
coefficients of odorants: water, water-ethanol- mixtures, matrices containing lipids and more&#13;
complex samples, such as mixtures of water, oil, proteins and polysaccharides.&#13;
The studies included a series of lactones, esters and alcohols (γ-octalactone, γ-nonalactone, γ-&#13;
decalactone, δ-octalactone, δ-nonalactone, δ-decalactone, ethyl hexanoate and ethyl&#13;
octanoate, 3-methyl-1-butanol and 2-phenylethanol).&#13;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The vapour pressures and partition coefficients were determined using static headspace gas&#13;
chromatography (HS-GC) techniques. The influence of the model systems on the adsorptions&#13;
of the odorants at the gas-tight syringes were taken into account. The results obtained, showed&#13;
that the vapour pressures of the flavour compounds are decreasing with the increasing of the&#13;
molecular weight of the compounds. The comparison of water/air partition coefficients&#13;
(logP&lt;sub&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;W/A&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;) with miglyol/air partition coefficients of selected odorants (logP&lt;sub&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;M/A&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;) showed that&#13;
for miglyol system, the logP&lt;sub&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;M/A&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; are higher than the logP&lt;sub&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;W/A&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; for all flavour compounds studied.&#13;
The measurement of the partition coefficients of selected aroma compounds in water-oil&#13;
matrices (emulsions) revealed that the fat content of emulsions influence significantly the&#13;
partition coefficients of odorants. The highest partition coefficients were obtained in&#13;
emulsions where the portion between water/miglyol/emulsifier was: 47.5 + 47.5 + 5, w/w/w.&#13;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the present study the flavour release of different aroma compounds (ethyl hexanoate and S-&#13;
(-)-limonene) in carbohydrate-water solutions was examined. The static headspace method&#13;
allows the measurement of the released odour components that interact with β -cyclodextrin.&#13;
The HS-GC analysis of β -cyclodextrin-water/odorant mixtures showed a reduction of the&#13;
odorant in presence of the carbohydrate.&#13;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The influence of the various matrices on the human biological response of odorants was&#13;
investigated by an olfactometer (e.g. determination of the threshold values of odorants in air&#13;
and in the presence of ethanol) and the headspace odour activity values (HOAV’s) were&#13;
calculated. The results showed that the threshold values in air in absence of ethanol were&#13;
lower than the values in presence of ethanol, which means the presence of ethanol in the&#13;
matrix increase the threshold value of the odorant.&#13;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The studies also included the influence of wine matrix onto the partition coefficients of&#13;
important wine flavour compounds. The quantification of the aroma compounds in white&#13;
wine samples was achieved by isotope dilution analyses and standard addition method.&#13;
Odorants in the headspace above wines were analysed by HS-GC techniques and the partition&#13;
coefficients (wine/air) calculated. The results pointed out that the presence of ethanol in wine&#13;
matrix does not influence the partition coefficients of selected aroma compounds. The highest&#13;
partition coefficients in wines were found for the two alcohols: 2-phenylethanol and 3-&#13;
methyl-1-butanol.&#13;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Concerning COST Action 921 custard samples were investigated as real foodstuff and the&#13;
aroma compounds were quantified in the matrix and in the headspace above the food. The&#13;
research data indicated that the partition coefficients custard/air are located between the&#13;
partition coefficients water/air and partition coefficients miglyol/air, but closer to the&#13;
miglyol/air values. Furthermore the mass transfer rates of selected odorants were investigated&#13;
in custard- and milk powder/water samples. The values of the mass transfer rate were found&#13;
higher in milk powder/water systems than in custard model. Nevertheless the results indicated&#13;
that the viscosity of the matrix did not significantly influence the values of mass transfer rate&#13;
of selected flavour compounds.&#13;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Molecular Modelling methods have been used for the prediction of solvation free energies of&#13;
the flavour compounds studied in different model solutions, e.g. water and water-oil systems.&#13;
The results showed that the predicted values (Mopac 97) for γ-decalactone, γ-nonalactone and&#13;
2-phenylethanol in water are in good agreement with experimentally solvation free energies.</dc:description>
