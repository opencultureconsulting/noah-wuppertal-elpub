          <dc:description xml:lang="en">&lt;p&gt;If two parties want to communicate over an insecure channel, they typically execute&#13;
an interactive cryptographic handshake to establish a shared secret, before&#13;
any application data is sent. In contrast, zero round-trip time (0-RTT) protocols&#13;
allow a sender to immediately send encrypted application data (0-RTT data) to a&#13;
receiver without executing an interactive handshake. One of the major challenges&#13;
when designing 0-RTT protocols is to guarantee forward security for the 0-RTT&#13;
data. Forward security ensures that compromise of a communicating party does&#13;
not impact security of past communications. However, the lack of interactivity in&#13;
0-RTT protocols renders it difficult to achieve forward security for the 0-RTT data.&#13;
Only recently, novel techniques to overcome this challenge have been discovered.&#13;
This thesis investigates design approaches to 0-RTT protocols and proposes new&#13;
constructions of 0-RTT protocols with forward security for all sent data.&lt;br&gt;&#13;
This thesis starts with a discussion on the concept of forward security in noninteractive&#13;
settings. Traditionally, forward security can be achieved if communication&#13;
partners interactively agree on fresh secrets. However, this view limits the&#13;
understanding of what forward security should mean in a non-interactive setting.&#13;
Hence, we propose new terminology for a unified treatment of forward security,&#13;
capturing both interactive and non-interactive communication settings.&lt;br&gt;&#13;
The remainder of this thesis can be split into two parts. The first part focuses on&#13;
the design of 0-RTT key exchange protocols. We investigate how to build 0-RTT key&#13;
exchange protocols from Bloom filter key encapsulation mechanisms, and describe&#13;
the first mechanism with constant-size ciphertexts. We then use this scheme to&#13;
construct the first multi-hop 0-RTT protocol for efficient connection establishment&#13;
in the context of anonymous communications.&lt;br&gt;&#13;
The second part of this thesis focuses in 0-RTT session resumption protocols.&#13;
Session resumption protocols require an already established secret shared between&#13;
sender and recipient. This secret can then be used to re-establish a secure connection.&#13;
Despite prior belief, we present the first 0-RTT session resumption protocol&#13;
that indeed achieves forward security for all messages. In contrast to existing&#13;
0-RTT key exchange protocols, our 0-RTT session resumption protocol is highly&#13;
efficient as it only relies on symmetric primitives. We show that our protocol can be&#13;
incorporated into the recently standardized TLS 1.3 handshake without modifications&#13;
to client-side implementations. This means that our protocol is immediately&#13;
deployable by content providers without requiring changes to the standard.</dc:description>
