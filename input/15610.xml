          <dc:description xml:lang="en">&lt;p&gt;The South Asian summer monsoon is associated with a large-scale anticyclonic circulation&#13;
in the Upper Troposphere and Lower Stratosphere, which confines the air mass inside.&#13;
During boreal summer, the confinement of this air mass leads to an accumulation&#13;
of aerosol between about 13 km and 18 km (360 K and 440 K potential temperature), this&#13;
accumulation of aerosol constitutes the Asian Tropopause Aerosol Layer (ATAL). In this&#13;
thesis balloon-borne aerosol back-scatter measurements of the ATAL are presented by the&#13;
Compact Optical Backscatter Aerosol Detector (COBALD) instrument in Nainital in Northern&#13;
India in August 2016, and in the post-monsoon time in November 2016. The presence&#13;
of an ATAL is then detected by the enhancement of the August measurements compared&#13;
to the November measurements. The measurements demonstrate a strong variability of the&#13;
ATAL’s altitude, vertical extent, aerosol backscatter intensity and cirrus cloud occurrence frequency.&#13;
Such a variability cannot be deduced from climatological means of the ATAL as they&#13;
are derived from satellite measurements. To explain this observed variability a Lagrangian&#13;
back-trajectory analysis was performed using the Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere&#13;
(CLaMS).We identify the transport pathways of air parcels contributing to the ATAL&#13;
over Nainital in August 2016, as well as the source regions of the air masses contributing&#13;
to the composition of the ATAL. The analysis reveals a variety of factors contributing to the&#13;
observed day-to-day variability of the ATAL: continental convection, tropical cyclones (maritime&#13;
convection), dynamics of the anticyclone and stratospheric intrusions. Thus, the ATAL&#13;
is a mixture of air masses coming from different atmospheric height layers. In addition, contributions&#13;
from the model boundary layer originate in different geographic source regions.&#13;
The location of strongest updraft along the backward trajectories reveal a cluster of strong&#13;
upward transport at the southern edge of the Himalayan foothills. From the top of the convective&#13;
outflow level (about 13 km; 360 K) the air parcels ascend slowly to ATAL altitudes&#13;
within a large-scale upward spiral driven by the diabatic heating in the anticyclonic flow of&#13;
the South Asian summer monsoon at UTLS altitudes. Cases with a strong ATAL typically&#13;
show boundary layer contributions from the Tibetan Plateau, the foothills of the Himalayas&#13;
and other continental regions below the Asian monsoon. Weaker ATAL cases show higher&#13;
contributions from the maritime boundary layer, often related to tropical cyclones, indicating&#13;
a mixing of clean maritime and polluted continental air. On the one hand increasing&#13;
anthropogenic emissions in the future are expected because of the strong growth of Asian&#13;
economies, on the other hand implementation of new emission control measures ( in particular&#13;
in China ) have reduced substantially the anthropogenic emissions of some pollutants&#13;
contributing to the ATAL. It needs to be monitored in the future, whether the thickness and&#13;
intensity of the ATAL will further increase, which likely impacts surface climate.</dc:description>
