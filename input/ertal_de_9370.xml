          <dc:description xml:lang="en">&lt;p&gt;In recent years the need for efficient processes in container terminals has grown due to the increasing volume of maritime transport.  &#13;
With the help of Automated Stacking Cranes (ASCs) which store and relocate containers in container terminals the container handling processes can be improved significantly concerning time and productivity. &#13;
Within this work, elaborate planning procedures for two different ASC-settings are developed.&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;First, a novel approach regarding the scheduling of triple-crossover-cranes is presented. &#13;
Here, three cranes, consisting of a crossover-crane and two twin-cranes, work jointly in a storage block. &#13;
While such a setup promises high productivity in container handling, interference between cranes likely increases. &#13;
As a result, a fast branch-and-bound approach, that tackles the scheduling of cranes is developed, while &#13;
conflicts between cranes are resolved by a sophisticated heuristic or exact procedure. &#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Second, a scheduling approach for two twin-cranes that cooperate is presented. &#13;
In this setting, containers enter and leave the block exclusively at the seaside access point, resembling e.g. the ongoing (un-)loading of a&#13;
vessel. The storage block is divided into two seperate areas by a handshake bay and each of the cranes exclusively serves&#13;
one of the areas. Whenever a container needs to be transported across that bay on its way to its final destination, it&#13;
first is stored in one of multiple, capacitated storage slots within the handshake bay by one crane before afterwards&#13;
the transport is completed by the respective other crane. Precedence constraints arising from stacking&#13;
containers on top of each other are examined and multiple branch-and-bound approaches allowing to obtain minimum&#13;
makespan schedules are developed.</dc:description>
