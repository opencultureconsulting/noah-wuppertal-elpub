          <dc:description xml:lang="en">&lt;p&gt;In the European Union (EU), the upcoming Euro-6d regulation will include Real&#13;
Driving Emissions (RDE), measured by a Portable Emission Measurement System&#13;
(PEMS). The regulation will comprise the on-road measurement of Diesel NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;&#13;
and Particle Number (PN) emissions on an RDE compliant test route. Chassis&#13;
dynamometer tests, such as the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC), are not&#13;
able to cover the entire spectrum of driving situations that occur during on-road&#13;
driving. On-road exhaust measurements depend on numerous conditions, such as&#13;
ambient temperature, driving style and road grade that can hardly be accounted&#13;
for in the test cell.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;The present study addresses the impact of different driving conditions on onroad&#13;
exhaust emissions. The focus is on the characterisation of different driving&#13;
styles, the fraction of cold start emissions and the correlation with road grade&#13;
along a route profile, which are all expected to have a high impact on exhaust&#13;
emissions. Gaseous emission results for three Diesel vehicles (Euro-4, Euro-5 and&#13;
Euro-6.1) and PN measurements with a prototype PN PEMS for two gasoline&#13;
vehicles (Euro-5, Euro-6.1) are presented.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Correlation measurements of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; emissions were conducted between the PEMS and the test cell which proved the PEMS results within a deviation&#13;
of 4 to 15% from the test cell. The PN PEMS showed a good agreement with&#13;
an established Particle Measurement Program (PMP) set-up down to emissions&#13;
of 1·10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; km&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. A PM PEMS was used in parallel for soot measurements as an independent technique. PN-to-soot ratios were determined for both test cell and on-road measurements, and appeared to be comparable at 1.3·10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; mg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; indicating a constant performance of the PN PEMS.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Different driving styles (soft, normal, severe) were characterized by several driving&#13;
parameters. Especially acceleration based driving parameters Relative Positive&#13;
Acceleration (RPA), Mean Positive Acceleration (MPA) and v·a&lt;sub&gt;pos&lt;/sub&gt;95 were found&#13;
to show a good separation of different driving styles. Most notably, elevated RPA and MPA could explain increases of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and PN emissions during&#13;
severe driving. The comparison to reference data obtained from the World harmonized&#13;
Light-duty Test Cycle (WLTC, version 5.3) and from Field Operational&#13;
Tests (FOT) proved that the normal PEMS trips can be attributed to normal&#13;
driving.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;The cold start effect was investigated down to ambient temperatures below 0°C.&#13;
A large cold start peak was observed, especially for CO, HC and PN emissions,&#13;
which constituted to a large fraction of the corresponding total emissions. Several&#13;
methods were applied to quantify cold start emissions during on-road driving and&#13;
define Cold Start Excess Emissions (CSEE).&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Based on different altitude data sources, the route characteristics of four routes&#13;
were investigated applying the parameter Cumulated Altitude Gain (CAG). One&#13;
route had more than 100% as much CAG, leading to almost 100% higher distance&#13;
specific NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; emissions at similar driving dynamics. A filtering and a subsequent&#13;
smoothing process, as implemented in the RDE regulation draft, lowered the cumulated&#13;
altitude gain values by 40 to 50%. Based on repetitive measurements,&#13;
the road grades for two routes were calculated within 100m segments with an&#13;
average precision of 0.29% and 0.12%. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; emissions showed a linear increase with road grade for all urban, rural and motorway parts. Larger emissions at higher road grades could be explained by more frequent high engine load&#13;
points.&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>
